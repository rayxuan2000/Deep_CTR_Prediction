# Deep_CTR_Prediction

## introduction
In the realm of online advertising, many campaigns operate on a 'pay-per-click' (PPC) model, wherein advertisers only pay when their ads are clicked on, rather than just being viewed. Consequently, for a search engine like ours, the optimal strategy involves selecting ads based on their 'expected value.' This metric is calculated by multiplying the price of a click by the probability that the ad will indeed be clicked. The higher this expected value, the more favorable it is to display the ad. Therefore, to maximize this expected value, it's crucial to accurately predict the likelihood of a particular ad being clicked, commonly referred to as the 'click-through-rate' (CTR).

In this project, I will use several models, mainly divided into matrix factorization based method, tree-based method and deep models, to predict CTR in a dataset.
